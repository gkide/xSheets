# ACPI is short of Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
# Displays information from the /proc or the /sys filesystem

# List the enabled ACPI modules for your running kernel
# A small pice of ACPI kernel modules
# => ac         power connector status
# => fan        fan status
# => i2c_ec     EC SMBus driver
# => processor  processor status
# => battery    battery status
# => sbs        smart battery status
# => video      status of video devices
# => button     catch button events, like LID or POWER BUTTON

# The acpi package displays information from the /proc or the /sys filesystem,
# such as battery status, thermal information, and more ACPI related information.
