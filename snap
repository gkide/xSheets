# Displays a summary of snaps installed in the current system
#
#  Name        The name of the snap package that was installed.
#  Version     The version number of the software in the snap package.
#  Rev         The revision number of the snap package.
#  Tracking    The channel this snap package monitors for updates. There are four:
#  => Stable      The default channel. As its name states, this channel contains the most stable packages.
#  => Candidate   This channel is less stable, but very close to it because it contains release candidate
#                 level software, which is code-complete. It goes through final testing before it’s moved
#                 to the stable channel.
#  => Beta        This channel is late development-cycle quality, but it’s not guaranteed to be stable.
#  => Edge        For early build testers. You shouldn’t use this channel for important work or on a
#                 production computer. Here be dragons!
#  => Publisher   The individual, company, or organization that released the snap package.
#                 If it was a verified publisher (and your terminal window supports Unicode), you’ll see
#                 a green check mark beside the name of the publisher. If it can’t show a check mark,
#                 you’ll see an asterisk (*).
#  Notes       Any comments or additional information will appear here.
